In the comments on my post about part-of-speech tagging, [Manu asks]({{ site.nav.main.posts }}/2011/06/30/part-of-speech-pos-tagging-with-opennlp-1-5-0#comment-342),

> Can you post a legend what the pos tags stand for? <!--more--> At the moment I’m working on a project where I use this and I dont know at the moment how much tags there are and what e.g. “JJ”, “IN” and the rest of them means. This would be very helpful.

Ask and you shall receive!
