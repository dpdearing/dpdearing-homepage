    <p>
      Hi.  I'm David Dearing, an AI Software Engineer at <a href="http://stottlerhenke.com">Stottler Henke</a> in Seattle.
      These days I mostly write applications in Java and Scala, but I am comfortable using a variety of languages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides geeking out on side projects I also like traveling, brewing (and of course drinking) beer, hiking, and (infrequently) snowboarding.
    </p>
    <p>
      I received my BS in Computer Science & Engineering from the <a href="https://www.cs.washington.edu">University of Washington, Seattle</a> in 2004.
